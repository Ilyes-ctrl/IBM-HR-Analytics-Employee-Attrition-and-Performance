# Introduction
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it increases recruitment costs, reduces productivity, and impacts overall performance 👥.
To better understand the factors driving attrition, I analyzed the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset 📊 from Kaggle, which contains detailed information
on employees’ demographics, job roles, income, satisfaction levels, and work patterns. Using Power BI ⚡, I cleaned and transformed the data, created key KPIs,
and built interactive dashboards 📈 that highlight attrition trends across departments, genders, age groups, job roles, and overtime status, providing actionable insights
to support HR decision-making.
